# Multi-AI Trello Power-Up - Complete Todo List

## 🎯 Goal: Achieve full production-ready functionality for the Multi-AI Trello Power-Up, addressing all identified issues and completing all necessary features.

---

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & Trello Integration (High Priority)

### 1.1 Implement Real AI API Calls
- [✅] Connect the frontend to actual AI provider APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, fPerplexity).
- [✅] Implement logic to handle API key authentication for each provider.
- [✅] Create functions to send requests and receive responses from all integrated AI models.
- [✅] Ensure proper error handling for API call failures (e.g., invalid key, network issues).

### 1.2 Complete Trello Mode Integration
- [✅] Implement Trello Power-Up context detection to differentiate between standalone and Trello environments.
- [✅] Use the Trello Power-Up API to fetch all card data (title, description, comments, checklists, attachments, etc.).
- [🔄] Implement attachment processing (text extraction from documents, OCR for images). [Framework created, full implementation pending]
- [✅] Pass all collected card data to the multi-AI analysis engine.
- [✅] Display analysis results as a Trello card overlay or in a modal window.

### 1.3 Enhance Error Handling & User Feedback
- [✅] Implement a global error handling system to catch and display user-friendly error messages.
- [✅] Provide specific feedback for common issues (e.g., "Invalid OpenAI API Key", "Trello API connection failed").
- [✅] Add loading indicators and progress bars for all asynchronous operations (API calls, attachment processing).

## Phase 2: UI/UX & Aesthetic Polish (Medium Priority)

### 2.1 Finalize Results Display
- [ ] Design and implement a polished, professional-looking results display area.
- [ ] Ensure the four-part analysis is clearly presented with icons and color-coding.
- [ ] Add a section to show which AI models were used for the analysis and their confidence scores.
- [ ] Include a cost breakdown for the analysis based on the models used.

### 2.2 Improve Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Thoroughly test the application on various mobile devices and screen sizes.
- [ ] Fix any layout or styling issues to ensure a seamless mobile experience.
- [ ] Optimize touch interactions and ensure all buttons and controls are easily accessible.

### 2.3 Create User Onboarding & Help System
- [ ] Design a simple, intuitive onboarding flow for first-time users.
- [ ] Create a help section with FAQs, tutorials, and contact information.
- [ ] Add tooltips and contextual help to explain complex features (e.g., AI strategies, API keys).

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Debugging (Low Priority)

### 3.1 Complete Debug Console Functionality
- [ ] Implement the "Export" functionality to save debug logs to a file.
- [ ] Implement the "Test All" functionality to run a suite of automated tests.
- [ ] Add more detailed performance metrics to the Performance tab (e.g., API latency, processing time per model).
- [ ] Enhance the State tab to show the complete application state in a readable format.

### 3.2 Implement Export & Sharing
- [ ] Add functionality to export the analysis results as a PDF or Markdown file.
- [ ] Implement a "Share" button to generate a unique link to the analysis results.
- [ ] Create a public-facing page to display shared analysis results.

### 3.3 Add User Accounts & Persistence
- [ ] Implement a simple user account system to save API keys and preferences.
- [ ] Use a secure method to store user data (e.g., browser local storage with encryption).
- [ ] Allow users to view their analysis history and past results.
