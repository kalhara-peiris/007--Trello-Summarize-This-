## Files With Matches

The following files contain one or more of the target patterns. Each is assessed below:

| File | Pattern hits | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| `adminApi.js` | password, token, mock | Inactive file (requires undeclared deps). Patterns are in legacy stubs and documentation strings. |
| `advanced-modules.js` | placeholder, TODO | Legacy module. Not part of shipped flow. Contains comments about future integration points. |
| `ai-providers.js` | token, secret, mock | token/secret references are in error sanitization patterns (removing them from output). mock is used in tests only. |
| `analytics-dashboard.js` | TODO, placeholder | Legacy analytics module. Not in shipped flow. |
| `analytics-framework.js` | TODO | Legacy module. Not in shipped flow. |
| `artillery-processor.js` | token | Load test file. Not in shipped flow. |
| `attachment-processor.js` | token | Used in error sanitization to detect and strip sensitive URLs. Not a stored token. |
| `backend-app.js` | password, token, secret | password — stored in memory (documented as not production-safe). token — used correctly as Bearer token auth. secret — JWT_SECRET environment variable reference. |
| `backend-config.js` | password, secret | JWT_SECRET and ADMIN_PASSWORD are environment variable names. Not hardcoded values. |
| `backend-doctor.js` | password | Reference to ADMIN_PASSWORD env var. |
| `batch-processor.js` | placeholder | Legacy batch module. Not in shipped flow. |
| `card-intelligence-ledger.js` | token | Used in Trello API auth. |
| `connection.js` | password, token | Legacy DB connection file. Requires pg dep. Not active. |
| `connector.js` | token | Trello API token in authorization-status check — correct use. |
| `credit-usage-analytics.js` | mock | Legacy analytics. Not in shipped flow. |
| `custom-prompts.js` | placeholder | Placeholder is used as a UI label string, not a code placeholder. |
| `database-user.js` | password, token | Legacy DB user module. Requires pg dep. Not active. |
| `environments.js` | token, secret | Legacy environment module. |
| `errorHandler.js` | TODO | Legacy file. Not in shipped flow. |
| `export.js` | token | Trello auth token reference in export helpers. Correct use. |
| `index.html` | mock, fake, placeholder | Demo page (not Power-Up entry). Contains sample card data with these words. |
| `integration-modules.js` | TODO, mock | Legacy integration scaffolding. Not in shipped flow. |
| `intelligence-modules.js` | placeholder | Legacy module. Not in shipped flow. |
| `multi-ai-integration.js` | mock | Legacy multi-AI module. Not in shipped flow. |
| `popup.html` | token, secret | token — Trello API token fetched through t.getRestApi(). secret — referenced only in sanitizeUserVisibleError to strip secrets from errors. |
| `realtime-transcription-client.js` | token | Deprecated WebSocket client. Not in shipped flow. |
| `settings-powerup.html` | token, password | token — Trello auth references. password — API key inputs are of type="password" for masking. Correct use. |
| `summarizer-core.js` | token | Referenced only in safeUpdateUrl and safeTrelloCardUrl to block unsafe patterns. |
| `trello-admin-config.js` | password, token, secret | Legacy admin config. Not in shipped flow as standalone. |
| `trello-integration.js` | token, secret | Trello REST API auth token (correct use). Secret reference is in error sanitization. |
| `useWebSocket.js` | token | Legacy WebSocket client. Not in shipped flow. |

## Verdict

**No unsafe credential storage in shipped flow files.**

All token/secret/password references in the active surface (`connector.js`, `popup.html`, `settings-powerup.html`, `ai-providers.js`, `trello-integration.js`, `summarizer-core.js`, `attachment-processor.js`) are:
- Error sanitization patterns (stripping, not storing)
- Trello API auth flow (correct, required use)
- API key input fields of type="password" (correct HTML)
- Environment variable name references (not values)

Legacy/inactive files with patterns are documented in `docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md` as not part of the shipped surface.

## No Fake Production Behavior

- No file presents a mock AI provider as a real production provider.
- Local rule-based analysis is explicitly labeled as "Local rules" in all output metadata.
- Provider fallback is documented and labeled in the popup UI.
- Confidence is labeled as a review signal, not a measured accuracy claim.
