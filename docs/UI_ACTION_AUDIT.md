## Active UI Surfaces

### connector.js — Power-Up connector

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| card-buttons | Wired | "Summarize This" button opens popup.html. Error boundary added in Phase 115 — returns empty array on failure rather than crashing. |
| card-detail-badges | Wired | Reads settings + ledger history. Shows confidence %, "Analyzed", "Review needed", "Analysis failed", or "Setup needed". Error boundary added in Phase 115 — degrades to fallback badge on failure. |
| show-settings | Wired | Opens settings-powerup.html |
| authorization-status | Wired | Returns { authorized: Boolean(token) } via Trello REST API |
| show-authorization | Wired | Opens authorize.html |

### popup.html — Main analysis popup

| Action | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Load card context | Wired | card, board, list, comments, activity, checklists, attachments, custom fields |
| Run local summary | Wired | buildRuleBasedAnalysis() always runs as fallback |

## Hidden or Removed UI Actions

- No actions are hidden that would appear active to the user.
- `startBatch()` automatic execution is explicitly absent from popup (verified in test.js assert.doesNotMatch).
- `DOMContentLoaded -> checkForUpdates()` auto-trigger is explicitly absent (verified in test.js).
- Card description writeback has no UI entry point — it is simply not implemented.

## Phase 115 Changes

- `card-buttons` callback now has `(t)` parameter (was `()`).
- Both `card-buttons` and `card-detail-badges` now have error boundaries that degrade gracefully.
- Badge fallback shows "Summarize This" in light-gray on unexpected errors.
