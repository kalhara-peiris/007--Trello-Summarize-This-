# Phase Status Ledger

Date: 2026-07-23 (Final Ledger Audit)

Status meanings:
- `Implemented`: completed with working code, verifiable test assertions, or complete truthful documentation artifacts in `docs/`
- `Blocked`: cannot be completed from repo-only work without external accounts, credentials, or live production infrastructure (see `docs/BLOCKED_PHASES.md`)
