Date: 2026-07-23 (Phase 012)

## Configured Providers

### OpenAI

- **Deployment:** `npx wrangler deploy` from `proxy/` directory.

### Local Rule-Based (Built-In)

- **Output quality:** Structural summary from card metadata only. Not AI-generated.
- **Labeled as:** "Local rules" in all output metadata and popup UI.

## Fallback Chain

```
User selects provider
  → Direct provider call
  → If fails: proxy call (if configured)
  → If fails or no keys: local rule-based analysis
```

## Honesty Constraints

- The local rule-based analysis is always labeled "Local rules" — never presented as AI output.
- Provider errors are displayed with sanitized messages, not swallowed silently.
- Confidence is a heuristic quality signal, not a measured accuracy percentage.
- No provider is presented as available when it is not configured.
