## 📝 Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:

1. **Attachment Processing:**
   - PDF text extraction requires PDF.js library (framework ready)
   - Word document parsing requires mammoth.js (framework ready)
   - Excel parsing requires xlsx.js for .xlsx files (CSV works)
   - Image OCR requires Tesseract.js (framework ready)
   - Large file processing may be slow

2. **Export:**
   - PDF export uses browser print dialog (not direct PDF generation)
   - No batch export of multiple analyses
   - No export history

3. **Onboarding:**
   - Only shown once (can be reset by clearing localStorage)
   - No way to replay tutorial from UI

### Recommended Future Enhancements:

**Phase 3 Priorities:**
1. Integrate PDF.js for full PDF text extraction
2. Integrate mammoth.js for Word document parsing
3. Integrate xlsx.js for Excel file parsing
4. Integrate Tesseract.js for image OCR
5. Add "Show Tutorial Again" button
6. Implement analysis history
7. Add batch export functionality
8. Create shareable analysis links
9. Add cost tracking and budget limits
10. Implement user accounts for settings sync
